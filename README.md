# Simplexhc

This is supposed to be a simple compiler for a lazy functional programming language
like haskell Core (hence "hc" = "haskell compiler")

I am trying to verify if ideas in polyhedral compilation can be used on lazy
programming languages, by trying to go the `Core` -> `STG` -> `LLVM` route.
